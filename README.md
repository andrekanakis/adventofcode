# 🎄 Advent of Code

--------

This is a repo over my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/)

Advent of Code is a series of fun coding challenges during the month of December.
These solutions are not made in an attempt to reach the global leaderboard but
rather for personal development and for fun!

The repository is organized by folders, a folder for each year and each day is put
into a subfolder of its own. No build files or sample data from AoC is uploaded.
